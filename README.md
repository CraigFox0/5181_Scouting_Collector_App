# 5181 Scouting Collector App

Android app for FRC Team 5181's scouting

## How to Install
Compile code into an apk file, then sideload it onto Android devices running Marshmallow (API Level 24) or higher.

## How to Use
Once app is installed on phone or other device, use it to record the performance of one robot per match at FRC 2020 Infinite Recharge competitions. This means six Android devices are needed to record all robots during a match. Data is saved locally on the phone in a Room database. From there, transfer the database to a computer (the best way is to browse the phone's files through Android Studio and manually move the database onto a computer). Then, all the databases from each phone can be combined and processed by whatever data visualization and analysis software you are using.
